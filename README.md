# Edx_Recommender
**A Movie Recommending System** Based on the Movielens Dataset.

My Capstone project for my [HarvardX's Professional Certificate](https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/8af9d02c7f244b97be2b35b041568df6/).

After an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis, I built a recommending system using [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) at its core.

Regarding its performance, it yielded a [root-mean-square error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) of 0.86 (with ratings ranging from 0 to 5).
